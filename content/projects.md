### Lensline.nvim
> Modular nvim codelens support with inline references, git blame and more

Lensline.nvim is a Neovim plugin that provides modular codelens support, allowing you to see inline code references, git blame information, and other contextual data directly in your editor.

It is completely modular and extensible, allowing users to create their own lenses and have multiple codelense profiles.
