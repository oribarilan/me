Hi, I'm Ori.

> *Give me coffee to change the things I can, and beer to accept those I can't*

## About
I like building AI-based systems that solve a real need. I work in multi-disciplinary teams that collaborate across the stack to deliver data-driven products and features.

Currently my weapons of choice are Python and Azure using Azure AI Foundry, OpenAI, Azure ML on top of the classical cloud engineering stack (K8s, Blobs, Queues, EventHub, Kusto, and more).

I love to geek out about software craftsmanship and give technical hands-on workshops and sessions.

I spend my personal time with my family, woodworking, playing casual chess or, how not, hacking side-projects.

## Outside the Office

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge in hands-on technical sessions.
Here are some of the workshops and talks I've delivered recently.

### From Dependency Hell to Environment Heaven  
From “it works on my machine” to reliable, repeatable Python setups. A practical tour of local, containerized, and cloud-based environments, with concrete tools and a cheat-sheet you can actually use.

### Introduction to Azure OpenAI
A fast-paced, hands-on 45min introduction to Azure OpenAI – deploy a model, call its API, and wire it into a small app to see the magic in action.

### Building LLM-powered Applications
Five days of LLM basics and practical app-building – combine core concepts with guided coding while you develop your own idea into a working prototype, covering prompt engineering, context management, tool calling, RAG, and more.

### Frictionless Repos: Designing Codebases That Teams Love to Work In.
Practical patterns for collaboration-ready repos. From command runners and formatting to dev containers and CI/CD, learn how to reduce setup pain and keep contributions flowing.

## Education
### B.Sc. + M.Sc. @ Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
- B.Sc. in Computer Science (Software Engineering track), **Dean's excellence award**.
- M.Sc. in Software and Information Systems Engineering
- Thesis on “Automated Software Fault Localization" (Italy, 2017).
